HOW TO RUN:
1) Download the git repository to your local machine.
2) Find the repository in your file system, extract the zip file.
3) Double click the "index.html" file.
4) This should open the file in your default browser, with all functionality loaded.
5) If the page seems unresponsive, run a server from the same directory of the "index.html" file, and access the server via localhost or something similar. For     more information on how to run a server, I found this webpage to be helpful: https://komelin.com/articles/three-simple-servers-your-front-end-projects/
